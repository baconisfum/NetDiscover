                <p> <b>NetDiscover:</b> A Network Discovery and Documentation Application </p>
                <br><p>
                    NetDiscover, a network utility application, allows users to create and visualize their network through a topological map layout. NetDiscover is a user-friendly, affordable, low-maintenance network mapping tool that small companies and enterprises employ to monitor their networks. NetDiscover is geared toward assisting small businesses which are unable to monitor their networks effectively. NetDiscover provides a simple user interface where clients effectively and efficiently check the health of their network with local network topology construction, modification, and inspection.  NetDiscover has an updated, modern user interface design.
